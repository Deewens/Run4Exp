## Context

This project was one of the biggest university project I made in team to get my third year diploma in Computer Science. The following paragraphs helps you to understand the purpose of the application.

Following a catastrophic report by Sant√© Publique France on the physiological state of students in France, the Ministry of Health wants to create an application to motivate youngs to do sports. 

The idea is to design an application that allows you to run a race in a virtual world. In order to progress in the virtual race, it is necessary to run or cycle in the real world, but also to solve puzzles or challenges in order to overcome certain obstacles that will be set up on the road.

# App design <a name="archi" ></a>

* Web app: written in TypeScript using ReactJS Framework.
* Mobile app: written in JavaScript and TypeScript using React Native framework.
